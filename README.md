`fzutility` is intended as a tool for owners of the Casio FZ-1 sampler. It can convert existing binary files (with extensions `.fzb` /`.fze` /`.fzf` /`.fzv`, obtained via MIDI) into an XML-based text format (FZ-ML, file extension `.fzml`), or vice versa. It is intended to serve as a complement to the `FzDump` tool that can be found [here](http://zine.r-massive.com/casio-fz-sampler-archive/).

For binary files or FZ-ML files that contain wave data, this can be extracted as `.wav` format files. Inspection of the individual blocks in a specified file is also supported.

Some additional features may also be added to support e.g. building or modification of FZ-1 banks and voices on a computer, but no concrete plans exist at present.
